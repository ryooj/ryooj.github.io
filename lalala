"Overall responsibility for converting new (i.e. trial) users into active users, including strategy, project idea generation, and project prioritization."
2.	Describe Your Leadership Experience - Even if you're applying for an individual contributor role, state what leadership experience you've had. Mention number and duration of direct reports, interns/junior PM's you've mentored, or other ways you've led others.
3.	Use Data - Imagine the reader saying, "So what?" after reading every sentence of your resume. If there is something impressive about what you did, answer the question. Ideally, answer it with data and communicate it appropriately. For example: "Grew world-wide trial-to-active user conversion from 10.6% for FY 2009 to 14.2% for FY 2010, an increase of  360bps".
4.	Skip the Objective and Summary Sections - Your objective is to get a job at my company. I know that if I'm looking at your resume. Skip the boilerplate objective that says you're looking for a challenging, blah, blah role.  Also skip the summary section that discusses your qualities. Saying you are a seasoned leader in a summary doesn't convince anyone. The roles, accomplishments and deliveries in your resume are where you can demonstrate this.
5.	Pick the Right Technical Skills to Include - If you have built technology yourself or are adept at SQL and other query languages then go ahead and add a technical skills section. Skip the section if you're just using it to show that you are familiar with the MSOffice Suite and Windows 7.
6.	Make Sure it Matches Your LinkedIn Profile - The first thing I do when I get a resume is look a candidate up on LinkedIn. I scan their profile and look at mutual connections. If I see different stuff there than on your resume (e.g. a degree in progress vs. a completed degree) then warning bells go off. Fix it.
7.	Find a Messenger - Avoid submitting a resume through a company's job site. If possible, try to find out who the hiring manager is, then find mutual connections. LinkedIn works great for this. If you can, email it to them directly with a very brief cover letter. If you can't, find someone you know at the company who can refer you. Some companies pay a referral bonus so if you're going to go through a referrer who's not the hiring manager send your resume to them first. Don't submit it through the jobs site and then email it to your contact.

Finally, a word on cover letters. Some hiring managers like them, some don't. I don't. A long cover letter might actually delay me in reviewing the resume, since I feel I need to slog through the cover letter as well. If you must add a cover letter, then simply name drop and pick one or two of your most meaningful accomplishments.
